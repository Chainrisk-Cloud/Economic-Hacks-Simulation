# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
anvil --fork-url "https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/Pm9ZgeSGJWEXWRTYWkuJAMjcR-8ME1ma" --fork-block-number 11129513 --hardfork london
node ./test.js
```
