## Description
This repository contains simulations of economic exploits in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) using Agent-Based Modeling (ABS). We'll be adding new simulations of various DeFi exploits using the ABS approach over time.

## About Chainrisk:
Chainrisk helps DeFi applications manage economic risk through Chainrisk CloudÂ®, our automated economic risk management platform. We specialize in simulating complex economic exploits to help DeFi projects identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

## Agent-Based Modeling (ABM)
ABM represents individual actors, or agents, with specific economic motivations and decision-making abilities, mirroring real-world participants in DeFi. By simulating interactions among these agents, ABM unveils emergent phenomena, such as unintended consequences, which may not be evident through traditional analytical methods. 

## Agent-Based Simulations
Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) is a bottom-up simulation technique where we analyze a system by its individual agents that interact with each other. In Chainrisk's ABS, individual actors, or agents, are represented with specific economic motivations and decision-making abilities, mirroring real-world participants in DeFi. </br>
By simulating interactions among these agents, ABS unveils emergent phenomena, such as unintended consequences, which may not be evident through traditional analytical methods.
The components of ABS Model are:
- Agents
- Scenario
- Observers
- Assertions
- Contracts 

## How Chainrisk's ABS can help DeFi Protocols?
ABS provides a powerful tool for DeFi developers to proactively identify and mitigate economic exploits. Below are a few features of ABS:

- **Exploit Detection**: allows for the exploration of a wide range of attack scenarios, uncovering potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited in the real world.

- **Stress Testing Protocols**: Simulations can be used to push the DeFi protocol to its limits, identifying weaknesses that might not be apparent under normal operating conditions.

- **Quantified Risk Assessment**: By analyzing the outcomes of simulations, developers can gain a quantitative understanding of the potential impact of different exploit scenarios.
